# learn some bootstrap from Udemy, Angela Yu is such a good teacher OMG! Very conperhensive and informative, highly recommended.

But this project is just soso, always good to learn something new, people says nobody using bootstrap now, but I don't think so. 

Maybe it is true, but the skills are the same. You know how to make egg fried rice, then it is very easy to learn Kimichi fried rice right?
